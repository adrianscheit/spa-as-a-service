# spa-as-a-service
Single Page Application as a Service POC

## Idea
Around 2015 I came with idea to create a SPA application as a service where input would be a DB structure. After many iterations of trying this out, and finding out that it is much harder than I initially though, I came last year with idea to limit the scope of it to just frontend, letting the backend do whatever the need is.

## Challanges
- Designing a basic  API for the solution
- Solving problem of a custom extending the basic solution

## Techonlogies
JSON - feels like a most obviuos decision for the API
Node with typescript on both server and browser side, would allow to reuse the API definition
